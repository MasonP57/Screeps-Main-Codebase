Container mining
Creating creeps based on maximum amount of resources available - start with this and set some kind of condition later to do stationary mining, this way restarting is easier
Mathing out optimal upgrader amount
Building defenses
Builders prioritize extensions over roads
Making sure roads get repaired

2 sources = 6000 energy, 20 energy regenerated/tick on average, 5 minutes per source to regenerate to full
2 stationary miners made of 1 move 50 energy 5 work 100 (550 energy total for most basic container miner)


Check how the memory works. If everything in a room has an ID attached to it, then something like container ID memory being able to be assigned a worker ID should be do-able, in which case workers should check the ID's of containers to see if they're occupied.

This could be extended to workers operating on routes as well


Remove harvesting from builders/repairers - prevent clogging
Should saturate sources for 3000energy/300ticks from RCL1 by optimizing costs of workers and then switch over to stationary miners and transporters that take energy and store it in extensions. Builders/repairers should only get energy from buildings. Upgraders should also only get energy from buildings.

A rate of expenditure should be calculated (cost of replenishing forces as well as drain to controller + repairs) and should be maintained below income levels




(actual first priority is making defenses)
FIRST PRIORITY: creating workers based on available resourceCapacity and calculating how much energy to put into workers to get to that point (making too many is wasteful)
